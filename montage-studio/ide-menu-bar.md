# Menu Bar

The menu bar at the top provides quick access to common menus for creating and saving projects, changing views, and accessing help topics.

>**Important:** Be sure to save often and save your changes before you log out of Montage Studio. Montage Studio currently will not save your changes automatically.

The Project menu lists the New, Save, and Source items. New has commands to create a new project, component, or module, Save commits all your current changes, and Source takes you to the project repository on GitHub.

The Edit menu has the Undo, Redo, and Delete commands. Use Undo to reverse the most recent changes in the editor, or Redo to keep the change you just undid. Use Delete to remove the currently selected item (template card or node) from the Component editor.

The Help menu includes links to the Montate Studio and MontageJS documentation, MontageJS API reference, and user forum, as well as a link for filing bug reports.

The master badge tracks how far ahead of the master-actual your project is. Each time you save your project, Montage Studio commits your changes, and each commit increments the number by 1.

The profile button to the right lets you log out of the current project and Montage Studio session.
