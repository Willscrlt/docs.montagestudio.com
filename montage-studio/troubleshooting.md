# Troubleshooting


**I'm getting an error: "Montage from https://xyz.project.montagestudio.net/ timed out while booting."**

If you're seeing this error or having trouble logging in, you need to clear the montagestudio cookies:

1. Open Chrome Settings (Chrome > Preferences) and enter **cookies** in the Search box in the top right.
2. On the Search results page, click Content settings.
3. Click All cookies and site data.
4. Search for **montagestudio** and click Remove all.
5. Log in again at [work.montagestudio.com](https://work.montagestudio.com).
