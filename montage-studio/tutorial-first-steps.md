    If you are not already logged into an active GitHub session, you will be redirected to the GitHub website and prompted to log in.
    
    If this is your first time using Montage Studio, GitHub will also ask you to give the application permission to access your GitHub account. To continue, click Authorize application.

    After logging into your Montage Studio account with GitHub, you will see the Montage Studio Project page where you can create new projects or access existing MontageJS projects in your GitHub repository.

3. Create a new project.

    Click New, enter a name and (optional) description, and click Create.
