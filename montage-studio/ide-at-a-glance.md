# At a Glance

Montage Studio is a development environment that helps streamline the development of MontageJS applications. It provides tools to help manage your development workflow, from creating a project to previewing and testing your application. It also leverages the declarative nature of the MontageJS framework to help you assemble applications by encoding your intent at a higher level than most other frameworks and toolsets. With Montage Studio, you can quickly assemble components and describe their relationships and then, using the built-in text editor, seamlessly move into writing the code you actually care to write.

## IDE Overview

The Montage Studio IDE is divided into three main areas: Menu bar, Package explorer, and Component editor.

* The menu bar at the top provides quick access to common menus and commands.
* The Package explorer on the left provides access to the files and folders of your project.
* The Component editor is the area where most of your development work is done.

## Text Editor

Montage Studio also provides a custom editing environment where you can write your code and modify the HTML, CSS, and JS files that make up the components of your application, or any other text files in your project folder. You can access the Code editor by selecting the files you want to edit in the Package explorer.

## Flow Editor

The Flow editor is a special editing environment that enables you to create a flow pattern that moves specified content along a BÃ©zier path. To access the Flow editor you first have to add the Montage Flow component to an application.

The Dependency editor provides a visual environment in which to edit the package information, dependencies, and dependecy information in your project's package.json file.
