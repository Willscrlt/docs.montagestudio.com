Naming Conventions
===

This document summarizes MontageJS-specific naming conventions and recommendations for modules, components, and CSS classes. Please refer to these conventions when creating MontageJS packages or contributing to the MontageJS framework.


## Modules

All module and package names are written in lowercase letters or numbers and delimited by dashes (for example, `child-package`).

## Components (.reel directories)
User interface components are stored in the ui directory of your MontageJS project and identified by a .reel extension.

The following naming conventions apply for `.reel` directories:

* Component names are always spelled in lowercase letters.
* If a name uses multiple words, follow a dash-delimited `"word-word"` pattern; for example, `radio-button.reel` or `text-field.reel`.


## CSS Classes

CSS class names follow a dash-delimited `package-Component` and `package-Component-childElement` pattern. For variations and states, double dash is used. For example, for the Digit Progress component it would be:

```css
.digit-Progress          /* package-Component */
.digit-Progress-bar      /* package-Component-childElement */
.digit-Progress--small   /* package-Component--variation */
.digit-Progress--loading /* package-Component--state */
```

More specifically, the following conventions apply:

* **Components:** All CSS classes are name-spaced with _package_ + _dash_ (for example, `montage-`, `digit-`, `matte-` and so on) and followed by the _Component_ name, which is capitalized; for example, a Button component would be `digit-Button`:

    ```html
    <button class="digit-Button">
    ```

    If a component name consists of more than one word, each new word also starts with an uppercase letter, a convention commonly referred to as _upper CamelCase_ ("CamelCaps") formatting; for example, `montage-InputRange`.

* **Composite components:** For components with children follow these conventions:
    * If a component has a child element, the child's name is written in lowercase (to signal the distinction between parent and child) and follows the componentâ€™s name separated by a dash; for example, `digit-Slider-thumb`.
    * If a child element consists of concatenated words, its name is written in lower camelCase; for example, `digit-Slider-thumbWithSpikyEars`.
    * If a component has multiple levels of child elements, each child can be separated from the other by a dash; for example, `digit-Slider-thumb-nobs-centerNob`. (_Note:_ This is not required in all cases as the class name would become too long. Only use if it makes sense.)

        >**Note:** Although technically there is _no limit_ as to how many levels of child elements can be used, if a class name becomes too long you may want to refactor the component into subcomponents.

* **Variations:** If a component offers variations, a double-dash is used; for example: `digit-Button--primary`, `digit-Slider--vertical`.

* **States:** If a component uses different states, an `is-` prefix is used; for example: `is-hidden`, `is-active`. It's advised to not style them globally because each component could handle a state differently. Limit it on a per component level: `.Component.is-hidden { display: none; }`.

### Rationale
These CSS naming conventions are similar to the [BEM](http://bem.info/method/) methodology with some minor syntax changes:

* Name-spacing classes with the package avoids name collisions when multiple packages are in use.
* Not using underscores ( _ ) increases usability because you can double-click each part to quickly select and edit it. (Try it: `digit-Slider-thumb` versus `digit_Slider_thumb`.)
* Using upper CamelCase for components highlights component/child relationship.
* Using lower camelCase for multiword names increases readability, but still keeps each part grouped together.
